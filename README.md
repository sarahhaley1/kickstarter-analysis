## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns Overview
#### The goal of this analysis was to find insights into the outcome of campaign strategies involving theatre based on the day they were launched and how that correlates to their success / failures
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#### In order to better view the outcomes of the theatre campaigns based on that day of launching the campaign, we creted a pivot table with the rows being "failed", "canceled", "live", and "successful" and the colums as the month that that campaign was launched. The filters on the pivot table are the Parent Category and selected "theatre" and the Year of launch. We avoided the challenge of days within the months by categorizing by month in the table. From there we attained the table below, which shows that most successful month to launch a theatre campaign was May or June, but the peak in this data is in May.

This was shown in the table of descriptive Statistics.
